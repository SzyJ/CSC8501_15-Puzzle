## Directory Structure
The input 15-files can be found in ```puzzle_app/15_files/```. This is also where grids generated by the program will be savd.

When a file is loaded, all grids in the file will be calculated concurrently and the results displayed. If the user chooses to save the solution file, it will be placed in ```puzzle_app/15_file_solutions/```.

An executable can be found under ```bin/Release-windows-x86_64/puzzle_app/``` where the above folders can also be found.

## Building a custom grid
Numbers can be entered normally and if an incorrect input is provided, the user will be warned about what went wrong. Once the grid is completed and ESC is pressed, the grid will be checked for validity (no duplicates and gap in bottom right).
To indicate a grid space as a gap, ```-``` character can be used in the input prompt.
